# Guides

A dual-axis index into this repository's guides — by concept, and by directory (AGENTS §22).

## By concept

| Concept | Spec                       | Source                    | Tests                                 |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Csv     | [`src/csv.md`](src/csv.md) | [`src/core`](../src/core) | [`tests/src/core`](../tests/src/core) |

## By directory

| Directory  | Guide                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| `src/core` | [`src/csv.md`](src/csv.md) |

## Dependency reference

[`src/contract.md`](src/contract.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide
for `@orkestrel/contract` — this package's `^0.0.5` runtime dependency. It
documents **that package's** surface (guards, combinators, parsers, and the
shape DSL), not anything sourced in this repo; it is kept here so a reader of
the CSV column shapes and compiled contracts (`columnTypeShape`,
`createTableContract`, …) can see the primitives they are built from without
leaving this guide set.

[`src/guide.md`](src/guide.md) is a byte-identical mirror of the guide for
`@orkestrel/guide` — the devDependency powering this repo's guides-parity test
suite (`tests/guides/src/parity.test.ts`). It documents **that package's**
surface (`Guide` / `Source`, the manifest and comparison helpers), not
anything sourced in this repo; it is kept here so a reader of the parity
suite can see the primitives it is built from without leaving this guide set.
